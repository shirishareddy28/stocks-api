# node-stock-data
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/bbialke/node-stock-data.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/bbialke/node-stock-data)

Node-stock-data is a simple, easy to implement stock tracking API for Node.js that uses [marketstack](https://marketstack.com/) to quickly get current or historical data on any stock.

## Features
#### Stock Lookup

- End of day stock data lookup (multiple stocks at a time)
- 1 year of historical stock data
- Filter by specific stock exchange
- Up to 100 simultaneous stock lookups
- Detailed information on stock highs, lows, trading volume, and more
#### Stock Exchange Lookup
- Country, city, and timezone information for any world stock exchange.
#### Plus, with a paid plan from marketstack:
- Intraday stock information lookup (presently supported on United States stock exchanges only)
## Installing

```bash
npm install node-stock-data
```
## API Token
Head to [marketstack](https://marketstack.com/) and obtain a free API token by creating an account.  
With a free account, you can make a maximum of 1000 API calls per month. You can check your usage from their dashboard.
## Usage
Since the API token is private, it's recommended to keep it in a separate configuration file or use it as an environment variable.

Each example uses:
```js
const stockdata = require('node-stock-data');
```
### End of day stock lookup
```js
// Get the latest end of day stock information for Boeing (BA)
stockdata.stocks(
{
  API_TOKEN: 'YOUR API TOKEN',
  options: {
    limit: 1,
    symbols: 'BA'
  }
})
.then(response => {
    ...
  })
.catch(error => {
    ...
});
```
### Ticker exchange information lookup
```js
// Get the latest information on the CD PROJEKT ticker on Warsaw Stock Exchange (CDR/XWAR)
stockdata.tickers(
{
  API_TOKEN: 'YOUR API TOKEN',
  options: {
    limit: 1,
    search: 'CDR',
    exchange: 'XWAR', //optional
    
  }
})
.then(response => {
    ...
  })
.catch(error => {
    ...
});
```
### Stock exchange information lookup
```js
// Get the latest information on the NASDAQ stock exchange (XNAS)
stockdata.exchanges(
{
  API_TOKEN: 'YOUR API TOKEN',
  options: {
    limit: 1,
    search: 'XNAS'
  }
})
.then(response => {
    ...
  })
.catch(error => {
    ...
});
```
When using the `search` parameter, both the exchange's name and their Market Identification Code (MIC) are accepted. For a full list of MICs, look at [this list](https://www.tradinghours.com/mic).
### Intraday stock lookup
- Note: This feature requires a paid plan on marketstack.
```js
// Get today's stock information for Boeing (BA), with intervals of 1 hour.
stockdata.stocksIntraday(
{
  API_TOKEN: 'YOUR API TOKEN',
  options: {
    limit: 5,
    interval: '1hour',
    symbols: 'BA'
  }
})
.then(response => {
    ...
  })
.catch(error => {
    ...
});
```
### Historical stock data lookup
```js
// Get the stock information for Boeing (BA) from January 7th, 2021 to January 9th, 2021
stockdata.stocks(
{
  API_TOKEN: 'YOUR API TOKEN',
  options: {
    limit: 3,
    date_from: '2021-03-15',
    date_to: '2021-03-17',
    symbols: 'BA'
  }
})
.then(response => {
    ...
  })
.catch(error => {
    ...
});
```
### Using results
```js
// Get the high price for Boeing (BA) on March 8th, 2021
stockdata.stocks(
{
  API_TOKEN: 'YOUR API TOKEN',
  options: {
    limit: 1,
    date_from: '2021-03-08',
    symbols: 'BA'
  }
})
.then(response => {
    response.data.forEach(element => {
      console.log(element['high'])
    })
  })
.catch(error => {
    ...
});
```
#### A couple notes for dealing with stock lookup results:
The stock lookup module returns a JSON array with this structure:
```js
{
  count: 1,
  data: [
    {
      "date": "2020-05-21T00:00:00+0000",
      "symbol": "AAPL",
      "exchange": "XNAS",
      "open": 318.66,
      "high": 320.89,
      "low": 315.87,
      "close": 316.85,
      "volume": 25672211.0,
      "adj_open": 318.66,
      "adj_high": 320.89,
      "adj_low": 315.87,
      "adj_close": 316.85,
      "adj_volume": 25672211.0
    }
  ]
}
```
This format of return means that to access the stock data, you'll need to use `response.data` instead of just using `response`. You can access the count of responses returned by using `response.count`.
